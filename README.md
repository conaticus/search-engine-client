# Search Engine Client

This is the client side application for my second attempt at a search engine. It works like [google.com](https://google.com/) and allows the user to make requests to the engine's API.

This runs in conjunction with the other two repositories:
- [Crawler](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-crawler)
- [API](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-api)
